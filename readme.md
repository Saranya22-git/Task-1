## 1.📚 Student Database Management System
This project implements a relational database system for managing student records, course enrollments, department details, and academic course data. It simulates a real-world academic environment using SQL and demonstrates schema design, relationships, and data management through structured queries.
## 2.🔧Technologies Used
- MySQL (tested with MySQL Workbench)
- Relational Database Principles
- SQL Scripting for DDL and DML
## 3.🗃️ Database Schema Overview
The database is composed of four core tables:
- Department_DB: Contains department names and HOD details.
- Student_DB: Stores student names, dates of birth, and department affiliations.
- Course_DB: Defines academic courses and credits.
- Enrollment_DB: Manages many-to-many relationships between students and courses.
## 4.Entity Relationships
- Each student belongs to one department.
